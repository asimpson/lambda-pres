# Ecosystem


## AWS!
- Lambda integrates really well with a ton of AWS services either through paved triggers/events or through the `aws-sdk`.


## S3
- The "filesystem" for Lambda.


## Cloudwatch (cron)
- Cloudwatch provides logging for Lambda functions but it also provides scheduled triggers (serverless cron)!
