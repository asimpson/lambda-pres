# Teach Lambda HTTP


## API Gateway 🌐

API Gateway is an API as a service that can register an endpoint with a Lambda function.


## 📺 ytrss

`ytrss.co` is a website I built in 2015 that provides RSS feeds for Youtube channels.


I've since ported `ytrss.co` to running exclusively via API Gateway + Lambdas.
